# Random-number
Ask user to guess random number
In this java project we ask user to guess random number.
If the number entered by the user is greater than our provided number then it returns "your number is too large".
If the number entered by the user is smaller than our provided number then it returns "your number is too small".
If the user guess the correct number then it returns "WOOHOO .. CORRECT NUMBER!!!"
If the user want to see what is the random number then user should provide a -ve number.
